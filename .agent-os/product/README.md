## Quick Start

1. **For Developers**: Start with the [Tech Stack](01_tech_stack.md) and [Architecture Overview](02_architecture_overview.md)
2. **For Product Managers**: Read the [Product Overview](03_product_overview.md) and [Roadmap](04_roadmap.md)
3. **For API Integration**: Refer to the [API Documentation](05_api_documentation.md)
4. **For DevOps**: Focus on [Architecture Overview](02_architecture_overview.md) and [Rails-Python Communication](06_rails_python_communication.md)

## Key Insights

### Technology Choices
- **Rails + Python Hybrid**: Leverages Rails' productivity for web features while using Python's scientific computing libraries for mesh generation
- **Microservice Architecture**: Separates concerns between web application and computational tasks
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration provides immediate feedback during processing

### Product Differentiation
- **Web-based**: No installation required, accessible from anywhere
- **Automated Workflow**: Converts PSD to Spine-ready meshes automatically
- **Customizable**: Adjustable mesh generation parameters for quality/performance balance
- **Collaborative**: Built for team workflows with project sharing capabilities

### Development Philosophy
- **Iterative Enhancement**: MVP first, then gradual feature addition
- **User-Centric**: Focus on artist/developer workflows
- **Scalable Design**: Architecture supports growth from indie to enterprise
- **API-First**: Everything accessible programmatically
