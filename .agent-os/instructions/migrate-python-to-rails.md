# Migrate Python to Rails - SpineLift

You are migrating Python desktop app functionality to Rails web service.

## Your Tasks:

1. **Analyze Python Code**
   - Review Python source in the original SpineLift project
   - Identify core algorithms (mesh generation, PSD processing)
   - Map Python modules to Rails services
   - Document dependencies

2. **Design Rails Architecture**
   - Create models based on Python data structures
   - Design service objects for business logic
   - Plan API endpoints
   - Design background job structure

3. **Implement Migration**
   - Port data models to Rails
   - Create Python service wrappers
   - Implement API endpoints
   - Set up file processing pipeline

4. **Integration Points**
   - Design Rails-Python communication
   - Implement error handling
   - Set up monitoring
   - Create integration tests

5. **Follow Migration Plan**
   - Reference docs/01_migration_plan.md
   - Use architecture from docs/03_architecture_design.md
   - Follow roadmap in docs/04_implementation_roadmap.md

## Key Considerations:
- Maintain Python core algorithms
- Use Rails for web interface and API
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Ensure backward compatibility where needed
