# SpineLift Rails - Product Analysis Summary

## Project Overview
SpineLift Rails is a web-based application for converting Photoshop (PSD) files into Spine animation assets with automated mesh generation. It's a migration of an existing Python desktop application to a modern web architecture.

## Architecture
- **Backend**: Rails 8.0.2 API with PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite
- **Processing**: Python FastAPI microservice
- **Real-time**: ActionCable (WebSockets)
- **Storage**: Active Storage with S3/R2 support

## Current State (40% Complete)
### ‚úÖ Implemented
- JWT authentication system
- File upload and project management
- Database models and associations
- Basic React UI with components
- Python mesh generation service
- JSONAPI standardized responses

### üöß In Progress  
- Background job processing (needs Redis)
- PSD layer extraction pipeline
- Service integration improvements
- Real-time progress updates

### ‚ùå Not Implemented
- Interactive mesh editing UI
- Export to Spine JSON
- Skeleton system
- Production deployment

## Technical Stack
### Backend
- Rails 8.0.2, PostgreSQL 16, Sidekiq
- Devise + JWT, Active Storage
- HTTParty, JSONAPI Serializer

### Frontend  
- React 18.3, TypeScript 5.6, Vite 5.4
- Zustand, Axios, Tailwind CSS
- Three.js (planned)

### Python Service
- FastAPI, OpenCV, NumPy
- psd-tools, Triangle
- Custom mesh algorithms

## Key Challenges
1. **Infrastructure**: Redis missing for async jobs
2. **Integration**: Multipart form handling needs fix  
3. **UI**: Mesh editing interface not implemented
4. **Performance**: Synchronous processing bottleneck

## Immediate Priorities
1. **Week 1**: Fix infrastructure and service integration
2. **Week 2**: Complete core processing pipeline
3. **Week 3**: Implement mesh editing UI
4. **Week 4**: Add export functionality

## Development Roadmap
### Short Term (1 Month)
- Complete MVP features
- Deploy to staging
- Begin user testing

### Medium Term (3 Months)
- Advanced mesh editing
- Skeleton system
- Production deployment

### Long Term (6-12 Months)
- Collaboration features
- Enterprise capabilities
- Platform expansion

## Success Metrics
- API response < 200ms
- Mesh generation < 5s
- 99.9% uptime
- MVP launch in 1 month

## Next Actions
1. Install Redis for Sidekiq
2. Fix multipart form handling
3. Enable background processing
4. Complete integration testing

## Resources Needed
- Backend Rails developer
- Frontend React developer  
- Python specialist
- DevOps engineer

## Risk Factors
- Python integration complexity
- Large file handling
- Real-time performance
- Scaling challenges

---

The project has a solid foundation with clear architecture and ~40% of MVP features complete. Primary blockers are infrastructure dependencies and service integration issues. With focused effort on the immediate priorities, the MVP can be completed within 4 weeks.
